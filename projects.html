                <h1 class="center_text">Optum:</h1>
                <p> During my internship with Optum this past summer, 2022, I had the privillage of working with the Microsoft platform. My team was given the job of 
                    putting together a system to take information from a Microsoft SharePoint list, to a SQL table in the Optum database. To do this, the team used Power
                    Automate, a Microsoft application that allows connections between Microsoft softwares to be done automatically. By using Power Automate, the team was
                    able to draw all the list information in the Microsoft SharePoint, then copy that information to an SQL table in the database. It happened automatically,
                    which means when there was an update to the Microsoft SharePoint, the SQL table would also get updated, mimicing the Sharepoint list perfectly. This project
                    allowed the active Microsoft Sharepoint list to exist in an SQL table, that way other services that create reports can pull the SQL table information, and 
                    render the report with the new information. This was not possible to gather from Microsoft Sharepoint automatically.

                <p>Last spring, I had the opprotunity to take a computer science elective, and I chose CISC 420, Computer Graphics. Later in the semester, we started to work on
                    a project that worked on lighting objects in a three dimensional world, displayed in two dimensions. There was Gouraud lighting and Phong lighting. The image
                    on the left shows a octagonal prism and a sphere in space, with three lighting sources currently selected in the scene. The lighting affects each object based
                    on the light source and the color. Also using the W, A, S, and D keys on the keyboard allow you to move the scene around. Using the left and right arrow keys
                    rotate the scene, making it possible for you to navigate any rendered scene with the light sources!

                <h1 class="center_text">CISC 130:</h1>
                <p>Spring 2021, I took my first computer science course! I was intended to be a mechainical engineer my freshman year, and as I stumbled into this class, I fell in love
                    with it! With CISC 130, I learned some of my first lines of code and I just knew that this was the career I wanted to go down. So, the image on the left is showing one 
                    of my lab assignments that spring. That class focused on C++ with Professor Myre, and we were working on recursion! These two functions were to display an array recursively,
                    and to reverse an arrays contents. This class is truly what sparked my interest in computer science, to the point that I decided to change my major just a week in to the class.
                    Seeing this project just reminds me of the excitement I had when I realized the power and creativity of coding along with problem solving, meant endless possibilites!
